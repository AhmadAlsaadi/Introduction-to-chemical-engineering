The second figure illustrates how the bands of separation occur as the injected mixture of compounds passes through the column. Note that the columns in indicate the distribution of the sample at different times, with time increasing from the left to the right. The component that is more strongly absorbed on the packing in the column falls behind the more weakly adsorbed. Some compounds with appropriate packing in a sufficiently long column can be completely separated.

The direct use of fish meal significantly increases the efficiency of the food chain. However, fish-protein concentrate, primarily for aesthetic reasons, is used mainly as a supplementary protein food. As such, it competes with soy and other oilseed proteins. In the processing of the fish, after the oil is extracted, the fish cake is dried in rotary drum dryers, finely ground, and packed. The resulting product contains 65% protein. In a given batch of fish cake that contains 80% water (the remainder is dry cake denoted by BDC for “bone dry cake”), 100 kg of water are removed, and it is found that the fish cake is then 40% water.
